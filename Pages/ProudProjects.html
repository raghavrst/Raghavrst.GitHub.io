              Fingerprint Based ATM is a desktop application where fingerprint of the user is used as a authentication. The finger print minutiae features are different for each human being so the user can be identified uniquely. Instead of using ATM card Fingerprint based ATM is safer and secure. There is no worry of losing ATM card and no need to carry ATM card in your wallet. You just have to use your fingerprint in order to do any banking transaction. The user has to login using his fingerprint and he has to enter the pin code in order to do further transaction. </p>

            European authorities and the international scientific community acknowledge the importance of Inquiry-Based Science and Mathematics Education (IBSME) to develop an integrated strategy for scientific literacy and awareness from primary to secondary school, reinforcing scientific careers. Scienceduc and Pollen FP6 projects as well as SINUS-Transfer have successfully implemented IBSME in a large number of European cities. Europe is now facing the urgent need to disseminate such approaches and enable all member States to have access, understand and implement them in a way that fits their own specificities.
            To go beyond best practices sharing and to provide effective know-how transfer at European level requires a dissemination model based on a systematic approach of IBSME at grassroots level, ensured by intermediary structures (universities, teachers training centres, research institutions...) with successful experience in local IBSME implementation. The FIBONACCI project defines a dissemination process from 12 Reference Centres to 24 Twin Centres, based on quality and global approach.</td>

            A proposal for a 14,000 square-metre Ripley’s Aquarium at the base of the CN Tower is going ahead.The city’s planning department is hopeful that final approval from city council will come in August. At issue is a technicality with the bylaw that pertains to the land, which currently does not specify it can be zoned for an aquarium. Several other changes to Ripley’s original proposal, such as the shape and exact positioning of the structure, will also need to be made. </td>
